This is a prototype for an online tool that can look at a chest x-ray and tell if a person has Tuberculosis (TB) or not. 

The dataset used to train the model consists of 800 images, which is quite small. Although the accuracy and F1 score are greater than 0.8, I'm uncertain of how well this model will generalize. Therefore, at the moment this is more of an experiment than something that can be used in the real world.

Model F1 score: 0.81
